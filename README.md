Inventory Management In Energy-Sector Industry Warehouses Using Machine Learning

The Energy Sector is a broad and comprehensive term that describes a complex and related network of companies, directly and indirectly, involved in the production and distribution of energy needed to power the economy and facilitate the means of production and transport.Inventory management is a difﬁcult problem area in the energy industry on large scale.

In order to overcome inventory problems it is important to have a efficient inventory management system, Companies must have inventory in storage to meet different requirements.


PROBLEM STATEMENT
DEFICIENT PROJECT DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT  :  Optimizing of materials according to the project or process where we can optimize the material usage .
ABJECT DEMAND FORECAST : Inefﬁcient demand forecasting, loss of credibility
INADEQUATE TESTING :  It does not give an efﬁcient result even after adequate testing , lack of efﬁciency of testing results may cause lots of problem in business
EXPENSIVE AND COMPLICATING :  Demands highly trained staff , Features between modules are least understood by business, but high on the list of reasons for purchase 
INADEQUATE RESOURCE : Classification of large datasets  is not possible  over large data , intricacy in resource managing
